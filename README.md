# Podium
Need more classroom engagement?\
Pollodium is a learning platform that is designed to foster friendly competition among peers. Students fight to claim their spot at the top of the podium through a series of questions created by the instructor. The instructor has the option to ask for typed responses or illustrated responses. After a poll, the students can look through their peersâ€™ answers and anonymously vote on the best response. Students whose responses are positively received by their peers will get points, and those with the most points at the end of the lesson will be at the top of the Podium!
